  "faq_q2": "Does this online Markdown editor store my content?",
  "faq_a2": "No. All Markdown content is processed directly in your browser. Your text is not uploaded or stored on our servers.",
  "faq_q3": "What Markdown syntax is supported?",

  "faq_q4": "Who is this tool for?",
  "faq_a4": "This tool is ideal for developers, technical writers, bloggers, students, and anyone who writes Markdown content.",
  "diff_faq_title": "Markdown Diff FAQ",
  "diff_faq_q1": "What makes this Markdown diff different from a plain text diff?",
  "diff_faq_a1": "Enter your original Markdown content in the left input, and the version you want to compare in the right input. Then click the \"Run diff\" button. The tool will automatically highlight all differences, including additions, deletions, and modifications.",
  "diff_faq_q2": "What formats are supported for comparison?",
  "diff_faq_a2": "This tool is specifically designed for comparing Markdown-formatted text. It supports all standard Markdown syntax, including headings, lists, code blocks, tables, links, and more. Differences are highlighted at both line and word levels.",
  "diff_faq_q3": "How do I navigate between different changes?",
  "diff_faq_a3": "After differences are detected, you can use the \"Prev change\" and \"Next change\" buttons to jump between multiple changes. The tool will automatically scroll to the corresponding change location, making it easy to quickly locate and review each modification.",
  "diff_faq_q4": "Is my diff data saved?",
  "diff_faq_a4": "No. All comparison operations are performed locally in your browser. Data is not sent to any server and is not saved. You'll need to re-enter content after refreshing the page.",
  "diff_page_how_it_works_title": "How This Markdown Diff Works",
  "diff_page_how_it_works_p1": "Instead of comparing Markdown files as plain text only, this tool understands Markdown structure. It splits documents into meaningful blocks such as headings, lists, tables, and code blocks before running the diff.",
  "diff_page_how_it_works_p2": "This approach reduces noise and helps you focus on real content changes, especially when working with documentation, README files, or technical notes.",
  "diff_page_language_support_title": "Language Support",
  "diff_page_language_support_p1": "Word-level diff works best for space-separated languages such as English. For languages like Japanese, Chinese, or Korean, diff results may be less granular due to language characteristics.",
  "diff_page_language_support_p2": "Line-level and block-level diff remain accurate across all languages.",
  "diff_page_privacy_title": "Privacy",
  "diff_page_privacy_p1": "All comparisons run entirely in your browser. Markdown content is never uploaded or stored on a server. Recent history is saved locally using browser storage only.",
